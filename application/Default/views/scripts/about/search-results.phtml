<p>After choosing their vehicle from the homepage, product from all categories can be displayed in a variety of formats</p>

<h3>Grid</h3>
<p>Product results from all categories can be displayed in a standard Magento grid or list view.</p>

<h3>Category</h3>

<h3>Grouped</h3>
<p>
    This allows users to expand and collapse categories, similiar to how "folders" on your computer work.
    <br />
    <br />
    The vehicle the user is searching on is clearly displayed at the top of the page.

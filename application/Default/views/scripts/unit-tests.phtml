<b>Automatic Testing For Developers:</b>
<p> In programming a frequent problem is that when changing code to add new features, old features can be easily broken. Unit tests pin down existing features so that they cannot be accidentally broken. It is like having a harness when rock climbing so you can climb but not fall.</p>
<p>If you wish to customize the code heavily, unit tests will help you by documenting the way the code works, and allowing you to fearlessly change the code around, while preventing you from breaking features of the software.</p>
<p>Vehicle Fits is developed using a comprehensive unit test suite, this ensures high quality software, frequent updates, and reduces the frequency & severity of any bugs - this ensures high quality production software for all. For our 'plus' customers we distribute the tests themselves in addition to the production code.. Over 1,500 tests are automatically run in a matter of minutes. This makes it easier for you to add-onto or change our code, and greatly reduces the risk of you causing a bug when changing our code around. <b>If you want to extend our software with custom code we highly recommend purchasing the unit tests</b>. When we release new versions of vehicle fits you can re-run the test suite to ensure none of our changes have broken your code, as well as vice versa. Creating the unit tests was a large investment on our part, which lowers the 'cost of ownership' for whoever is working with our code. Pretty soon the only problem your software team will have is too much free time on their hands!</p>
<b>Nightly Builds</b>
<p>Since our code is unit tested, its always in a working state. Because of this, we provide nightly builds to 'plus' customers. This is like always having access to beta test the new software, and preview changes in near real-time.</p>
